# Pill Pal (Full Stack Group Project for CodeStack Academy)

This is a final project for CodeStack Academy, where I worked as the "Product Manager/Team Lead" for a group project. I collaborated with two other classmates on this application. As the team lead, my responsibilities included creating a Jira board, organizing tasks, managing requirements, and designing the application using Notion and Figma. And I also focused mainly on the front-end code, while my classmate Griffin worked on the back-end, and Harrison worked on the front-end also.

>The Team:
>
>Brandon Le (Front-End/Team-Lead)
>
>Griffin Parker (Back-End)
>
>N. Harrison Wilkins (Front-End)
